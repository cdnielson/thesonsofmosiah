    <hr>
    <p>Rilla of Green Gables is a new musical based on the beloved Anne of Green Gables novels by Lucy Maud Montgomery.
        The timeless score features songs of the period by renowned composers Irving Berlin (Annie Get Your Gun, White Christmas)
        and Jerome Kern (Show Boat, Swing Time), freshly arranged and orchestrated.</p>

    <p>As her sweetheart and brothers leave to fight in World War I, Anne's daughter, Rilla, embarks on her own emotional
        journey at home that teaches her the importance of selflessness and sacrifice, changing her life forever. Touching,
        uplifting, and romantic!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>
    <p>
        The kernel of an idea that was to become this musical came to me in a moment of clarity that was unexpected and
        powerful, and afterward I felt inexplicably driven to see it realized on stage. I feel very blessed to have been
        part of the world premiere production, presented in August 2015 in Saratoga Springs, Utah.
    </p>
    <p>
        The wonderful cast and crew, many of whom had never acted or sung onstage before, gave so much time and effort
        and were an absolute joy to work with. This is to say nothing of the incalculable hours and musical creativity the
        talented Charles Dail Nielson gave to elevate this show far above what I would be capable of on my own.
    </p>
    <p>
        And, of course, none of this would be possible without the brilliant words and music of Lucy Maud Montgomery,
        Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, and their collaborators, and the incredible opportunity that is available to take
        works in the public domain and re-imagine them anew.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we commemorate the centennial of World War I—a war that few of us are as familiar with as we should be—it
        is fitting to reflect on the sacrifices made by not only the soldiers, but just as importantly, those who waited
        at home with faith in a better tomorrow.   We all weather storms in our own lives while clinging to that same
        hope that we will somehow be made better for what we’ve endured.  May we all learn a little something from the
        way Rilla is matured and strengthened by her trials, though they be as diverse as dancing with a clumsy partner
        and worrying over loved ones in harm’s way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rilla’s story is one I have treasured from the time I was a child, but every time I revisit it I find something
        new to ponder and appreciate.  My hope is that you will be as entertained and uplifted as I have by this story
        and these characters and the life these performers bring to them.
