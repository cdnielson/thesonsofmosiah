  "aboutText":"THE SONS OF MOSIAH is a musical based on the story in THE BOOK OF MORMON of Ammon, Aaron, Omner and Himni's visit to the Lamanites as missionaries in the book of ALMA, chapters 17-27. That story only outlines the primary plot, however, which is based on that story but involves mostly fictional characters. Any of this may change, however, as it is a work-in-progress.",
